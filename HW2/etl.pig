-- TASK
-- Aggregate events into features of patient and generate training, testing data for mortality prediction.
-- Steps have been provided to guide you.
-- You can include as many intermediate steps as required to complete the calculations.

-- TESTS
-- To test, please change the LOAD path for events and mortality to ../../test/events.csv and ../../test/mortality.csv
